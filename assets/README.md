# Password Generator

## Description

This project was created so that a user who deploys this website can generate a random password with their desired length and characters. The user is allowed to choose between lowercase letters, uppercase letters, symbols, and numbers. They are requuired to have a password length in between 8 and 128 characters and must choose at least one character option. I built this using JavaScript and it helped me to learn more about JavaScript. It helped me grasp the concepts of functions, variables, the DOM, and for loops.

## Installation

Click the github URL link to view the webpage. To view the code, click the link to the github repository. Download the repository to your computer and unzip the file. Open the index.html file to view the HTML code. Open the style.css file to view the style sheet. Open the script.js file to view the JavaScript code.

## Usage

When the link is deployed. The password generator is shown. When you click "Generate Password" you will be presented with a series of window prompts that ask you how long you want your password to be. For this password generator the password must be between 8 and 128 characters. You will then be asked if you want your password to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and special characters. After answering all the prompts and selecting at least one parameter a password will be generated and displayed for you.
